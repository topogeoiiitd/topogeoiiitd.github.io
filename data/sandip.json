We summarize the known structures of $\\mathcal{E}(X)$ for spaces like spheres and low-dimensional complexes. The discussion includes exact sequences relating $\\mathcal{E}(X)$ for products and wedge sums. Finally, we explore various generalizations obtained by considering free-, fiber-, equivariant-, and $H$-homotopy equivalences, highlighting their algebraic and geometric significance through classical results.",

    "abstract": "We survey explicit computations of the group of self-homotopy equivalences $\\mathcal{E}(X)$ for key spaces in homotopy theory. This includes results for pseudo-projective planes, with emphasis on lens spaces, as well as for Moore spaces $M(G, n)$ and twisted Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. We also discuss the structure of $\\mathcal{E}(X)$ for real, complex, and quaternionic projective spaces. Additionally, we present computations of $\\mathcal{E}_H(X)$ for rank one $H$-spaces, specifically $S^1$, $S^3$, $S^7$, $\\mathbb{R}P^3$, $\\mathbb{R}P^7$, and for certain higher-dimensional examples such as $S^3\\times S^7$, $S^3\\times S^3$, $S^7\\times S^7$, $SU(3)$, and $Sp(2)$. These cases illustrate the diversity and depth of self-equivalence groups across notable spaces in topology.",
