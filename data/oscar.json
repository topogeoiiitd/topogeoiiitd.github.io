Geometrical tools such as Lagrangian bisections will be defined and explained. In the last part of this session, we introduce so-called \"bi-realisations\". Those are local forms of symplectic groupoids. On bi-realisations, we will explain how a Hamilton-Jacobi allows to approximate Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds."

To conclude, we will summarize the results of this geometric approach to numerical analysis and give several perspectives."
