    "abstract": "We review, through examples, the foundational philosophy of Geometric Group Theory, where each group $G$ with a finite generating set $S$ is associated with a metric space $(G, dS)$, translating algebraic properties of the group into geometric features of the space. Although this assignment initially depends on the choice of $S$, such dependence vanishes when viewing $(G, dS)$ \"from infinitely far away\". This motivates the introduction of coarse structures.",

    "abstract": "We refine the structure of $HX^*(X)$, enhancing it to an algebra by endowing it with a product. Much like the cup product [3, §3.2] allows for a finer distinction between topological spaces, it is natural to seek products in coarse cohomology that sharpen the information it provides. A first strategy is to adapt the cup product to this context, but the resulting product in coarse cohomology turns out to be trivial. However, not all is lost: in such cases, one can define Massey triple products. In this session, we will introduce a closely related idea: the Roe product in coarse cohomology [5, §2.4]. This procedure can be abstracted to an algebraic setting, whose potential will later be exploited again."

    "abstract": "It is well known that the degree-zero singular homology of a topological space is determined by its path-connected components. Similarly, degree-zero Alexander-Spanier cohomology can be computed from its connected components. We ask whether, for a topological bornological space $X$, there exists a similar connection between $HB^{1}(X)$ and the ``components at infinity of $X$''. \n\nThis question naturally leads us to give meaning to notions such as rays in $X$, (path-)connected components at infinity, and ultimately to consider compactifications of $X$. After addressing this question, we generalize the tools involved by studying certain extensions of $X$ whose boundaries at infinity are Stone spaces [4], which can therefore be treated dually as topological spaces or as Boolean algebras (this is recent work in progress). \n\nWe will conclude the course by reviewing some questions that remain open."
