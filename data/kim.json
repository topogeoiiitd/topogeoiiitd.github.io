    "description": "Knot theory plays an important role in low-dimensional topology. Knots and links in Euclidean 3-space provide concrete and diagrammatic ways to encode topological information about 3- and 4-manifolds, and they have been used to study various problems in low-dimensional manifold theory. In this sense, knot theory serves as a bridge between low-dimensional topology and other areas of mathematics. <br><br> The goal of this lecture series is to provide a general introduction to knot theory and to explain how 3-manifolds can be described using knots and links. We will present several fundamental concepts, properties, and theorems, focusing on the main ideas rather than detailed proofs. <br><br> These talks are intended for researchers, graduate students, and advanced undergraduate students with a background in algebraic topology. No advanced prior knowledge of knot theory is required.",
    "about": "Seongjeong Kim is affiliated with Jilin University. His research focuses on knot theory, low-dimensional topology, and quantum topology. He is particularly interested in knot invariants, the Jones polynomial, and the applications of knot theory to 3- and 4-manifold theory.",
